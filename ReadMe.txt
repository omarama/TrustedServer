    CONSOLE APPLICATION : TrustedServer Project Overview
========================================================================
The Trusted Server can communicate with the Secure Enclave Application. Before the communication can 
start the publicID.txt, which contains the public long-term key of the Secure Enclave Application
must be placed in the upper folder of the TrustedServer.exe. The publicID.txt can be generated, if the
Secure Enclave Application was started once. It will be placed inside the File Application Project.
Please check the file and copy it manually.
